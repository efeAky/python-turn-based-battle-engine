# Turn-Based RPG Battle Simulator

A **fundamental Python RPG battle simulator** designed to demonstrate the basics of object-oriented programming, inheritance, and abstract classes. This project focuses on the **core concept of character classes, attacks, and cooldown-based special moves**—a simple foundation that is fully open for improvement and expansion.

## Purpose

This project is intended as a **learning example** for:

- Understanding and implementing **classes** and **inheritance** in Python
- Using **abstract base classes** to enforce methods (`Attackable`, `SpecialMove`)
- Creating a **turn-based battle system** with attacks, defense, and cooldown mechanics
- Practicing **interactive input** and basic game loops

It’s designed to be **extensible**, so you can:

- Add new character types or enemies
- Implement new special moves and abilities
- Improve the battle system or add features like items, levels etc.

## Features

- **Heroes:** Warrior and Mage
- **Enemies:** Orc and Goblin
- **Turn-Based Combat:** Characters take turns attacking until one dies
- **Special Moves:** Each character has a unique special attack with cooldowns
- **Interactive Selection:** Choose your hero and enemy from the console
