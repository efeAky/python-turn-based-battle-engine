# Python-Turn-Based-Battle-Engine - Learning Project

A simple turn-based combat game for learning Object-Oriented Programming in Python.

## What You'll Learn

- **Abstract Base Classes**: Using ABC and `abstractmethod`
- **Multiple Inheritance**: Classes inheriting from multiple parents
- **Polymorphism**: Different characters implementing same methods differently
- **Class Hierarchies**: Organized base and derived classes
- **Turn-Based Logic**: Cooldown systems and battle mechanics

## How to Run

```bash
python game.py
```

## Gameplay

Choose your hero (Warrior or Mage) and battle an enemy (Orc or Goblin). Each character has unique stats and special moves with cooldowns.
